# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

An attempt to further my understanding of various machine learning algorithms and concepts. Coding from scratch allows me to directly conceptualize and visualize what is going on under the hood of these algos. It also gives me an opportunity to understand how certain hypmerparameters effect performance. Finally, these projects will improve my general coding and OOP skills.


## Current Algorithims
* Stochastic Gradient Descent Regressor
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Q-Learning (Reinforcement)
